# telegram-bot
Hi!
This repository includes Python code for a Telegram bot designed to calculate salaries and wages. The bot's ID for use in Telegram is @acounting_e_bot. 

With this bot, you can store two types of users: "Manager" and "Employee." Based on their check-in and check-out times, you can receive their salaries in an Excel table format.
Enjoy using the bot!
